You have met your arch enemy
in the outskirts of a desolate galaxy,
on the edge of an event horizon.
Even though you cannot reach out to each other,
the two of you embrace
for an epic laser-weapon showdown.
But beware: With all the weird physics so close
to a black hole, you might encounter all sorts
of objects helping or damaging your cause.
